    "Aspiring DevOps Engineer",
summary: 
  "Hello! I'm Vansh Sharma, a DevOps enthusiast with a background in full-stack development. My journey began building client applications with the MERN stack, but I quickly discovered my passion for the architecture that underpins a seamless software lifecycle, from code commit to a secure, monitored, live deployment.\n\nThis passion drove me to master modern, cloud-native tools. I have hands-on experience designing CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions**, containerizing applications with **Docker**, and orchestrating them with **Kubernetes**. I build and manage infrastructure as code using **Terraform** and have implemented comprehensive monitoring stacks with **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.\n\nMy development background gives me a unique perspective, allowing me to bridge the gap between development and operations effectively. I am particularly interested in DevSecOps and am always integrating security best practices, like vulnerability scanning, directly into my automated workflows.",
